PixFC-SSE TODO list:

* Fix segfault happening when using unaligned buffer with some conversion routines
* Add aligned / unaligned use cases to unit testing
* Investigate where to place prefetching instructions and check its 
  platform dependency
* Investigate if using static xmm intermediate buffers instead of 
  stack-allocated ones significantly improves conversion performance.
* Update non-SSE conversion routines to perform resampling.
* Add support for more pixel formats:
  - VYUY, YVYU
  - planar formats (YUV420, YVU420, YUV410, YVU410)
  - packed RGB, grey and bayer formats.
* Hide internal functions so as not to pollute the namespace
* Improve perf by distributing conversion over many threads (OpenMP)
* Add SSE4.1 version of routines which use blending (up/down sampling for 
  instance)
* Some other things I cant think of.
